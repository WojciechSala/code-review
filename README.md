# What's Code-Review?

Code-review is a platform for entry levels to help them improve code quality by receiving code reviews from more advanced coders on their code they've posted.

###### Looking forward to revive the project but not in near future. Needs a redesign, think-through and code update maybe complete rewrite from the scratch.

#### Stack is simply MEVN

## Main user flow

The users posts the code he want's to be reviewed. Then users who review can access it through build-in text editor like [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) and leave reactions, notes, comments, change the code or fix it by commiting or direct message the owner.

## Challenges and roadmap

The project has a very wide opportunity to become alternative to github or stack overflow for junior developers who start their journey in programming.

- [ ] Implement pseudo social systems in the platform for easier communication and a **gate for mentoring** the coders.
- [ ] There are a lot of challenges in UX design to make all functions transparent and obvious enough for the user.
- [ ] Good server optimization and database choice is essential for platform speed.
- [ ] Hard to make RWD, very dependent on good UX.

## Installation

###### I don't see the point of trying to run the project manually since the code is pretty outdated and run problems will for sure occur. Note that most of the dependencies are already very outdated itself.

## Contributing

###### The project probably needs a full rewrite if you want to contribute to this project you'd be welcome to get in touch with me or open an issue.
